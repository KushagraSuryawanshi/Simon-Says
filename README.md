# Simon Game ðŸŽ®

A simple memory-based game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project was created nearly a year ago as one of my earlier ventures in development. I noticed that I hadn't written anything in the README back then, so Iâ€™m updating it now. Looking back at my work from a year ago gives me a chance to reflect on how far Iâ€™ve come as a developer since then.

## How It Works
- Press any key to start the game.
- The game shows a random sequence of colored buttons.
- Click the buttons in the correct order to proceed to the next level.
- If you click the wrong button, the game ends and displays your score.

## Key Features
- **Color Sequence**: The game highlights a random sequence of colored buttons for the player to memorize.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks the player's score and the highest score during the session.
- **Button Animations**: Provides visual feedback with button animations when clicked.
- **Simple and Engaging**: A clean and minimal design that keeps the focus on the gameplay.

## Lessons Learned
This project helped me understand and apply:
- **Event Listeners**: How to use JavaScript event listeners to handle user interactions (click events).
- **Game Logic**: Basic game mechanics, such as sequence tracking and score calculation.
- **DOM Manipulation**: How to manipulate the DOM to highlight buttons and display user feedback.
- **CSS Styling**: How to style elements for better user experience and visual feedback.

## Repository Purpose
This project is part of my journey to organize and showcase my older work on GitHub. Although it may not be perfect, it reflects my learning process and growth as a developer. Looking back, I can see how much Iâ€™ve advanced in the past year, and how my skills have progressed far beyond this simple game.
